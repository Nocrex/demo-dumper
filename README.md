# Demo Dumper
Small tool for getting random information out of demos (whatever I need in the moment)

What it can do so far:
+ Parse all demos in a folder and extract the players seen in each demo - simply run the binary in the folder with the demos
+ Extract (some) keyboard inputs
+ Extract voicechat audio
